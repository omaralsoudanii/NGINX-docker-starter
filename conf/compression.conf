# Compression settings for gzip and brotli
# same min length for both means: Hey NGINX I want brotli compression used
# on all the resources listed, but if the browser doesn't support it, then fallback to gzip
# if you are not restricted to a CDN or a dependency, you can tweak it better.

# For example you could make brotli min length 1024(1KB) and gzip 512(bytes) â€” gzip is fast, however
# for me if most of the resources are static or doesn't change much (and we have cache busing mechanism)
# then I'll choose brotli always, this is due to another factor.
# NGINX is compressing small files using brotli is a waste of CPU cycles, but if those files are cached then
# the client device de-compressing brotli is faster than gzip and lower on battery
# TLDR: based on the above (and your research) this can be tuned.
